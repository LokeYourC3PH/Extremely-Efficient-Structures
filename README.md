# Extremely-Efficient-Structures
Public repository for the Extremely Efficient Structures mod for Mindustry.

This repository will be updated in tandem with the Steam version whenever I release an update. 
You can download the .zip in the "Releases" section so that you may install the mod on any other version of Mindustry (Mobile, non Steam version, etc).

If you have issues finding the "Releases" section on GitHub, you can get to it by following this link:
